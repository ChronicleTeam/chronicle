#### About Their Work:
- They build tools for the military.
- Their work involves software development and data analysis.

#### Key Needs and Requirements:
- **Task Management:**
  - Currently, tasks are collected from emails.
  - They want task assignments to be synchronous and managed within the app.
- **Analysis and Monitoring:**
  - They want to analyze performance metrics (e.g., number of projects completed).
  - Teammates should be able to add updates, while Janelle monitors progress.
- **Dashboards:**
  - A dashboard is needed to visualize data and track projects.
  - Exporting dashboards as images is a requirement.
- **Data Management:**
  - They currently use Excel for tracking, which results in large, hard-to-manage spreadsheets.
  - They want good filtering options for projects, descriptions, and timelines.
  - Importing and exporting data is essential.
- **Email Replacement:**
  - Chronicle could replace correspondence emails (e.g., task assignments, updates).
  - They use Teams for team communication and SharePoint for file management.
  - Instead of sending files, they prefer sharing links (e.g., SharePoint paths).

### Challenges:
- Heavy reliance on email for communication and task assignments.
- Lack of a centralized dashboard makes managing data difficult.
- Spreadsheets are cumbersome and inefficient for their needs.

#### Access Control:
- They need granular access control:
  - Management-level permissions.
  - Limited access for members.
  - View-only access for certain users.
