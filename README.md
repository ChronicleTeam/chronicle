# Chronicle

An application for managing everyday data into collections and then easily create stylish dashboards for analysis. Chronicle can be used as a straightforward alternative to Excel for managing work or personal data without using a grid. Instead, it will use a graphical user interface (GUI) to create tables with typed fields, manage several collections, and filter/sort/search entries. A separate component of the app will allow users to create dashboards with graphs, aggregates, and sub-views. The GUI will focus on ease of use and avoid exposing the users to complex features. Essentially, Chronicle should be accessible to those without any experience with data science.

For example, someone could manage their bills, legal documents, groceries, family photos, and work hours, all in one place. Then, using beginner friendly tools, create a dashboard for bills spent per month, groceries count per week, photos and documents disk usage in gigabytes, and average work per day.

Chronicle should cover a wide range of use cases, for work, school, and personal life.

Finally, Chronicle will allow importing and exporting data and provide an option for local and cloud storage.
