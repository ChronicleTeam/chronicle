# Chronicle (WIP name)

An application for managing everyday data into collections and easily analyze it by creating stylish dashboards. Chronicle can be used as a straightforward alternative to Excel for managing personal data without using a grid. Instead, it will use a graphical user interface (GUI) to create tables with typed fields, manage several collections, and filter/search/sort entries. A separate component of the app will allow users to create dashboards with graphs, aggregates, and sub-views. The GUI will focus on ease of use and avoid exposing the users to complex features. Essentially, Chronicle should be accessible to those without any experience with data science. 

For example, someone could record data on weekly 5 km runs and create a dashboard with a line plot of the performance over time, the average time per run, and a historic of this months runs. 

Finally, Chronicle will allow importing and exporting data and provide an option for local and cloud storage.
