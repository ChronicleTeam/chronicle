# Chronicle

An application for managing everyday data into table and then easily create stylish dashboards for visualisation. Chronicle can be used as a straightforward alternative to Excel for managing work or personal data in tabular format. Using the graphical user interface (GUI), you can create tables with typed fields, create sub-tables, and filter/sort/search entries. A separate feature of the app allows users to create dashboards with charts with aggregates, filters, and sorting. The GUI will focus on ease of use and avoid exposing the users to a too large number of features. Essentially, Chronicle should be accessible to those without any experience with data science.

Importantly, all tables and dashboards can be shared accross users with robust access control, allowing for team collaboration.

Finally, data can be imported or exported with common file formats to allow for easy transition.
