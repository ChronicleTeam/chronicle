//! This module is responsible for all database queries
//! via [`sqlx`]. Each submodule represent a database entity
//! and defines functions for CRUD operations.
//! 
//! Since theses functions are meant to be used by the [`crate::routes`]
//! module, they should assume validation has already occured and return
//! only database errors on failures.
